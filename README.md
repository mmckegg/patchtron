# PATCHTRON 3000™️

Yet another SSB client! Probably gonna be Patchwork 4.0, but for now is missing a lot of things and under pretty serious development

## Install-a-reno!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/patchtron.git
cd patchtron
npm install

# start!
# this does use scuttle-shell, but make sure you don't have any other clients open (as it uses custom plugins)
npm start
```
